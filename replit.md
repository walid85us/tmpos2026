# System Architecture

## Frontend

The frontend is built using React 19, TypeScript, Vite 6, and Tailwind CSS v4.

## UI/UX Decisions

-   **Design System**: Consistent design language with `rounded-[2.5rem]` or `rounded-[3rem]` cards, `bg-white/80 backdrop-blur-xl` glass effect, and a primary color theme with a `ghost-border` utility.
-   **Typography**: `font-black uppercase tracking-widest` for labels.
-   **Animations**: Framer Motion (`motion/react`) for smooth UI transitions and consistent modal patterns with `AnimatePresence`.
-   **Notifications**: Toast notifications for user feedback.
-   **Accessibility**: Focus on semantic accessibility for forms, tables, and modals.

## Technical Implementations & Feature Specifications

-   **Authentication & Access Control**: Firebase Authentication with a 7-level hierarchical permission model.
-   **Tenant Management**: Full lifecycle management including provisioning, subscriptions, feature overrides, billing, and audit logging.
-   **Point of Sale (POS)**: Comprehensive system covering cart management, diverse payment options, tax/discount calculations, customer management, repair intake, held orders, quick add stock, operator switching with RBAC, refund workflows, and warranty claims.
-   **Employee Management**: Features employee, role, time tracking, and payroll management with granular permissions.
-   **CRM (Customers)**: Enriched CRM with multi-field search, loyalty management, duplicate detection, and integrated order/invoice history.
-   **Invoices**: Full invoice lifecycle management with dynamic line items, searchable catalog, payment processing, supervisor PIN-authorized reopen, and configurable document templates.
-   **Services**: Manages a service catalog with CRUD, warranty configuration, bulk price editing, and dependency-aware delete confirmations.
-   **Repairs Module**: Full repair ticket lifecycle management with structured workflow, parts tracking, technician assignment, activity timeline, and financial summary.
-   **Reporting**: Dashboard with data visualizations.
-   **Onboarding**: Multi-step process for new tenants including plan selection, pre-configured settings, and an activation checklist.
-   **Document Template Editor**: Structured template builder for 5 document types with deterministic HTML generation, branding, and visual preview.
-   **Inventory Management**: Comprehensive system for managing `StockItem` types (serialized, non-serialized, handset) with flags, UPC/manufacturer/location, min/max stock, cost price, serial number tracking, advanced filtering, stock adjustment, global movements log, inventory transfer lifecycle, stock count, and trade-in management. Integrates repair parts and POS sales movements with RBAC.
-   **Supply Chain Management**: Manages suppliers, purchase orders (PO) lifecycle, Goods Received Notes (GRN), and Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) with detailed tracking and financial recording, all RBAC-gated.
-   **Shipping Center**: Centralized fulfillment-ready module for managing shipments across all source documents, supporting various shipment types and source documents. Features include a shipment list with filters, a 3-tab detail view, create/edit modals with package management, status transition workflow, tracking event timeline, carrier/service level configuration, cost tracking, and integration for pre-populating data from source modules. Includes a provider adapter layer for external shipping carriers and a runtime mode architecture for write guards. Supports PDF-only primary label with print-ready workflow and robust post-dispatch lifecycle governance.

## System Design Choices

-   **Routing**: React Router v7.
-   **State Management**: Primarily React Context API and extensive local component state.
-   **Firebase Integration**: Firestore for backend data persistence and Firebase Authentication for user management.
-   **AI Integration**: Gemini API for AI functionalities.
-   **Server-Side Shipping API**: Express server (`server/index.ts`) on port 5001 handles all shipping provider operations. Credentials are stored securely server-side. Vite proxies `/api/shipping/*` requests in development.
-   **Configuration**: `firebase-applet-config.json` for Firebase project configuration and `firebase-blueprint.json` for Firestore schema definition.
